{"prompt": "Javascript: How do JavaScript closures work?", "completion": "Closure is a pairing of a function and reference to that function's outer scope (lexical environment) A lexical environment is part of every execution context (stack frame) and is a map between identifiers (i.e. local variable names) and values. Every function in JavaScript maintains a reference to its outer lexical environment. This reference is used to configure the execution context created when a function is invoked. This reference enables code inside the function to \"see\" variables declared outside the function, regardless of when and where the function is called. If a function was called by a function, which in turn was called by another function, then a chain of references to outer lexical environments is created. This chain is called the scope chain."}
{"prompt": "Javascript: Uses of Closures?", "completion": "Closures are useful whenever you need a private state associated with a function. This is a very common scenario - and remember: JavaScript did not have a class syntax until 2015, and it still does not have a private field syntax. Closures meet this need."}
