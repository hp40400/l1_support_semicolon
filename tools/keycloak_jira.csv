Since especially the {{configureUserProfile()}} method is very complex it is very likely that code based on the current implementation breaks easily with new keycloak versions.

This PR changes the creation of the {{DeclarativeUserProfileModel}} to receive its id from the caller, so that a custom user profile implementation derived from {{DeclarativeUserProfileProvider}} can store and load its configuration without the need to re-implement the component model class and the methods mentioned above.

Remaining methods that need to be overridden for custom user profile providers are the constructors, {{getId()}} and the 3 {{create()}} methods. This makes the interface leaner and more stable.

This behaviour can be observed for example when invoking the {{OpenShiftTokenReviewEndpoint}}.

The old implementation of Resteasy used in the wildfly dist. returns an empty MultivaluedMap instead.

To fix this behaviour, for now we should check the mediaType in these authenticators and only make the call if the actual request is a request which is compatible  .

 

_Note: A better fix would be to filter out the potential authenticators beforehand using the Content-Type of the request as a decision base, so that for requests with `application/json` the authenticators relying on form params would not be invoked in the first place.

My name is Quentin TEXIER.
I am pentester in the French company name ""OpenCyber"".

Indeed this endpoint is vulnerable to an XSS (Cross Site Scripting).
It allows to execute javascript code on the client side.

To do this you need to post the following payload using a ""POST"" request on this endpoint:
{code:java}
{""<script>alert('Quentin TEXIER - OpenCyber - XSS')</script>"" : ""test"",}
{code}
The javascript will be executed and the alert popup will be appear.

We can therefore easily imagine an attack scenario where the attacker prepares the post request on his website. (html form auto sent)
The attacker will just have to provide the url to the victim who when she will click on it will see the XSS executed on her web-browser.

An XSS can be used to retrieve cookies or perform actions without the victim's consent.

Keycloak does not support login with kubeadmin because the openshift-v4 Keycloak identity provider requires a non-null uid in order to be able to link the openshift user to the Keycloak user and incase of kubeadmin the user profile metadata doesn't contain such a uid.

KEYCLOAK-19388,AttributeConsumingService Bug in SAML SP metadata,"*Motivation:*

Keycloak version 15.0.0 introduced the AttributeConsumingService element in the SAML SP metadata. This is a useful feature since it allows mapping Attribute Importers into RequestedAttribute elements within the AttributeConsumingService. However the current implementation does not comply with the [SAML Metadata Specification|https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf]. Specifically:
* The AttributeConsumingService element is included in Keycloak’s SAML SP metadata by default, even if no RequestedAttribute elements are specified
* The ServiceName element is added only if the Attribute Consuming Service Name is set

According to the [SAML Metadata Specification|https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf], the AttributeConsumingService is optional (Zero or More) but when included it requires:
* one or more RequestedAttribute elements
* one or more ServiceName elements

As a result, the default Keycloak SP metadata are deemed as invalid by SAML IdP software (e.g. SimpleSAMLphp) that performs metadata schema validation. Effectively, users can not login with these SAML IdPs, unless the Keycloak configuration includes a Service Name and one or more Attribute Importers.

*Proposal: *

In order to be compliant with the [SAML Metadata Specification|https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-metadata-2.0-os.pdf], we propose the following:
# The AttributeConsumingService is added to the SP metadata only when at least one Attribute Importer Mapper exists
# The Attribute Consuming Service Name has default value the realm display name when configured, otherwise equal to the realm name. When the AttributeConsumingService is not required for the SP metadata (see point 1) then the Attribute Consuming Service Name is ignored.

The actual (external) client id is stored in the {{externalClientId}} field.

Therefore client offline sessions for external clients are always stored with the key {{external}} instead of the client (object) id in the {{UsersSession.authenticatedClientSessions}} map.

In consequence existing client sessions will not be found when for example a token refresh grant for one of these offline session is executed (after a server restart)."
